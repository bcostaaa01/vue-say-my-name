### 👋 Say-My-Name 

This project was created with Vue, a framework used to create user interfaces with a component-based approach, just like you would build a bunch of LEGO castle towers and connect them to the main castle building 🏰

## ⚙️ Code explanation

- the sayName function is triggered with an onclick event on the button, which renders the value of the myName variable in the HTML
